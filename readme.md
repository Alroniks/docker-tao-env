# docker-tao-env

These configuration files and scripts make it easy to stand up a [TAO](https://www.taotesting.com) environment using docker containers.


## Setup

1. Download and install Docker and Docker Compose. (https://www.docker.com/products/overview)

2. Clone this repository or download a ZIP archive of this repo. If you clone the repo, change the name of the folder (e.g. `taodoc` below).

  This name will be used as the project's name and other configuration values. For this configuration, the recommendation is to use _only_ alpha characters with no hyphens or underscores.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Alroniks/docker-tao-env taodoc
  ```

3. If you unzipped an archive, rename the folder (e.g. `taodoc`) to define the project name.

4. `make init`: This task will apply the project name to config files using the name of the current folder.

  If you want to run on a port other than `80`, for example `8080`, run `make init PORT=8080`.

5. `make up`: This task will cause Docker to pull down the images and run the containers. By default the latest production release of TAO will be installed. It can take a few minutes for this to happen.

6. Add your domain to `/etc/hosts`. The default domain will be `projectname.docker`, for example `taodoc.docker`.

  ```
  ... previous entries ...
  127.0.0.1   taodoc.docker   localhost
  ```


## Finish TAO installation

Now you can go to http://projectname.docker and complete the TAO web-based installation. Alternatively, you can run `make install` to complete a CLI installation.


### TAO Web-based Installation

Here a few screen shots with some form fields filled in with `taodoc` used as the project's name.

> **NOTE**: The database is configured by default to use the project name as the value for the database's name, the database admin's username, and the password for the database admin. Use `dbs` as the database's hostname. This is all configured in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Maintenance

To log into the container use `make shell`.

Also available commands: `make update` for updating project and `make down` for destroy container. Mysql container use shared data volume so you donâ€™t need to install project after every `up`.

Full list of command in `Makefile`.


## Troubleshooting

* Port 80 can only be used once in the system. If you already have a site running on port 80, consider using `make init PORT=8080` in step 4 above.

* To run multiple projects at the same time, use a local nginx configuration with proxied requests to the docker instances. Here is an example of the configuration:

  ```
  upstream mpart {
      server 0.0.0.0:2001;
  }

  server {
      listen 127.0.0.1:80;
      server_name taodoc.docker;
      root /Users/alroniks/dev/docker/taodoc;
      location / {
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
          proxy_pass http://taodoc;
      }
  }
  ```

* To run the `make` command in Windows, you might need the [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) utility.
